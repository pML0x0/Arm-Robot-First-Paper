# Arm-Robot
 Constraint MDP with UR5 arm robot simulated in Mujoco
 
 The main and the SAC algorithms are contained in the Scalarized Lagrange SAC, NonScalarized Lagrange SAC_V1 and NonScalarized Lagrange SAC_V2.
 
 The supporting note book for the sphere object is Helper_class2.
 
 Running the SAC notebooks should be all you need to do, after including the mesh ur5.xml file in your mujoco mesh folder and installing the dependencies you see in the imports.
